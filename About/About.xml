    <description>Has it ever bothered you how the orbital traders can just magically teleport items right out of your stockpiles? This mod puts an end to that. With &lt;b&gt;Realistic Orbital Trade&lt;/b&gt;, your pawns will now have to load up a shuttle with the goods you sold before the orbital trader gets their hands on them AND before you get your hands on the goods you bought.

The mod will guide you through all the required steps using the RimWorld quest and letter systems once you've made a trade with an orbital trader.

The mod can be added to a game at any time. Removing the mod should be fine as long as there is no active trading quest at the time. There will be a fairly large list of once-off errors when first loading such a save, however.

Mod compatibility is probably generally good, but there might be issues with mods that modify how orbital traders work or how vanilla shuttles work.

&lt;size=24&gt;Version&lt;/size&gt;

This is version 0.7.0 for RimWorld 1.5 and 1.4
