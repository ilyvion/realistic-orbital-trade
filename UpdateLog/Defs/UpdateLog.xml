                <header>Added a compatibility layer for Dynamic Trade Interface</header>
                <text>This is required because Dynamic Trade Interface uses a custom trade dialog instead of modifying the original, so Realistic Orbital Trade wasn't notified when a trade was cancelled when using it, leading to Realistic Orbital Trade thinking a trader had an active trade agreement when there wasn't any. This has now been corrected.</text>

                <header>Fixed labels in "Contents" tab on shuttles</header>
                <text>The fix for minified items from last version had a bug where it would show items with multiple counts as "ItemName x&lt;stackCountInStorage&gt; x&lt;stackCountNeeded&gt;" in the shuttle's "Content" tab. This has now been fixed to be just "ItemName x&lt;stackCountNeeded&gt;" as it should be.</text>

                <header>Added option to remove time pressure aspect</header>
                <text>Normally (i.e. before this release or in future releases with this new option unset), the orbital trader's depature timer will keep counting down even while there's an active trade. This adds an element of time pressure to the mod, which was how it was intended to be experienced. However, because different people have different playstyles and preferences, I've decided to add this option so that when it is set, an active trade stops the orbital trade ship from counting down its departure, and you can take as much time as you need to finish your trades.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Changed grace time calculation</header>
                <text>The way grace time was calculated was not very intuitive. Instead of adding the grace time to the existing time, the time was directly set to the grace time value. This meant that you could end up in a situation where when you were supposed to have grace time added, it would actually give you &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; time instead of more! For instance if the trader was leaving in 6 hours and you had set your grace time setting to 4 hours, the new trader leave time would be in 4 hours, not the expected 10! The logic is now that the grace time is added on top of the existing time, not replacing it.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Trade ships with grace time leave earlier</header>
                <text>Trade ships will now leave an hour after the last trade if their comms were closed; there's no reason to keep them around any longer than that.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Blacklisting affects all trades</header>
                <text>When you get blacklisted, all active trade quests will be cancelled, not just the one whose shuttle you destroyed.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Supress the "launch when ready" message</header>
                <text>Supress the "Shuttle is loaded with required cargo and can launch when ready" message that would appear after a trade shuttle was fully loaded; an artefact of vanilla-inherited behavior.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Fixed early cancellation bug</header>
                <text>If you cancelled a shuttle immediately after it landed, before it had time to build up its list of items to load, it would produce a NullReferenceException. This no longer happens.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Handle minified things correctly</header>
                <text>Minified items weren't being handled correctly, so any minified item would count as matching any other. This has now been corrected so that the "inner" item of the minified item is used for checking whether a given item matches what was traded for.</text>

                <header>Added Orbital Trade alert patch</header>
                <text>If "We Had a Trader?" or "Tweaks Galore" are active, Realistic Orbital Trade patches their alerts about orbital trade ships to include information about when they close their comms if the player triggered extra grace time in a trade.</text>
            </li>
            <li>
                <header>Fixed game loading bug</header>
                <text>There was a bug in the code that loaded trade information associated with trade ships, which meant that if you loaded a game while there was an orbital trader active with a grace time set, "time until comms close" got reset, and you could once again make trades with the trader even during the grace period. Similarly, you could initiate a second trade with a trader while another trade was already ongoing under the same conditions.</text>
